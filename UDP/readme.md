### THIS IS WHAT JYO TOLD....IK NO SHIT
- uap.py has the things to do encoding and decoding stuff...chatgpt and jyo did it

- Network.py has the client ig 

- implemented timer , states
- its working ig

- TODO:
    - Input taken from user , test it
    - Implement AsyncSever
    - Recheck the timeout thing in ThreadedClient

    @Lekshmijiii....AsyncNewServer.py sends hello to client after connection, receives messages, prints it in wrong pattern, it can take keyboard input...i have a function input_handler something, there are a lot of print statements for debugging in it...help me find why it is not sending a goodbye to client

    - some error msg comes , but when q is entered, it stops running...
    - about the GOODBYE from Server msg, client waits till something is entered, (enter key doesn't work) what should we do here?
